# Security Statement

Cyrethium prioritizes security and privacy above all else. I am committed to providing a reliable operating system that protects your data, ensures your anonymity, and defends against unauthorized access and surveillance.

## 1. No Data Collection

Cyrethium does **NOT** collect, store, or transmit any personal data, telemetry, or usage analytics. Your data remains solely on your device and is never shared with third parties or governments.

## 2. No Backdoors or Hidden Access

Cyrethium contains **NO backdoors, secret channels, or hidden functionalities**. The source code is fully open, auditable, and free from malicious access points.

## 3. Official Debian Repositories Only

All software packages and updates are sourced exclusively from official Debian repositories. No third-party, proprietary, or untrusted sources are used, ensuring software integrity.

## 4. Open Source Components

All components, including custom security tools and enhancements, are fully open source. There are no proprietary binaries or hidden modules embedded within the system.

## 5. Traffic Routing is User-Controlled

By default, **network traffic is NOT forcibly routed through the Tor network**. Users have complete control and may enable Tor routing at their discretion. Cyrethium provides secure configuration and tools, but the decision rests entirely with the user.

## 6. Hardened System Architecture

Cyrethium incorporates multiple security hardening layers, including but not limited to:

- Custom firewall and network filtering rules to block unauthorized traffic.  
- Permission and access controls that minimize attack surfaces.  
- Various system hardening measures to reduce exploit risks.  
- Regular updates aligned with Debian security advisories.

## 7. Transparent Development and Code Auditing

Cyrethium’s source code, development discussions, and security audits are publicly accessible. This transparency enables experts worldwide to verify the system’s security.

## 8. User Responsibility

While Cyrethium provides strong security foundations, ultimate privacy and security depend on user practices, including:

- Keeping the system updated.  
- Using strong and unique passwords.  
- Avoiding insecure software or configurations outside the Cyrethium ecosystem.

## 9. No Warranty

Cyrethium is provided "as is" without any guarantees. Users accept full responsibility for their use of the software.
